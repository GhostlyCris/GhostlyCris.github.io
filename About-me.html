                <p class="hero-description">
                    I am a passionate software engineer with a focus on software development.
                    I love creating interactive and user-friendly applications using C#. For web applications,
                    using modern technologies like React, JavaScript, and CSS are my gotos for web development.
                    Then as for Android I also like to use C# with xamarin or Java and Kotlin in Android Studio.
                    I have a strong background in computer science and a keen interest in software architecture. 
                    My goal is to build efficient and scalable software solutions that enhance the user experience. </p>
                <p class="hero-description">
                    Outside of development, I enjoy gaming, exploring new technologies, getting fit so I can eat,
                     and spending time with my family and friends. I also spend time doing live streams on Twitch and creating content for YouTube.
                    I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest trends in software development or technologies in general.

                            I have been creating content for YouTube and Twitch since 2018, focusing on gaming and software development.
                            I have been building a community on YouTube and currently have close to 200 followers on Twitch.
                            My content includes tutorials, live demos, and gameplay videos, showcasing my skills in software development and gaming.
                            It started as a hobby, but I have been able to grow my audience and build a community around my content.
                            I have also been able to monetize my content through sponsorships and donations. Although, I have not been able to make it a full-time job yet, I am working towards that goal.
